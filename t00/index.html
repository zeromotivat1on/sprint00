        <p>
            <br>
            A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and 
            has the ability to do them in a way that a normal 
            person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, 
            <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any 
            power a normal human being could possess,</b> and you 
            need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.<br>
            Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered 
            a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting 
            a bad guy could be just a regular police story or 
            detective story or human-interest story. But if 
            it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting 
            a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If 
            the good guy is doing something that a normal 
            human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then 
            I assume he becomes a superhero.<br><br>

            The guy goes to the Omegle website (an analogue of chat roulette) and trolls random people using a hat speech.
            So, one of his videos begins with the words “I hate niggers”.
            Hero was repeatedly blocked on Twitch and YouTube. 
            Therefore, he uploads all the content to the Bitchtube website. 
            Also, the cuts are made by the audience and the blogger fans themselves.
